# Fee-Entry-Project
## Project Overview
You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## How will I complete this Project?
1. Please use Angular.js or your favourite front-end mvvm framework.
2. Use design patterns which help reduce the complexity and depencies within your code.
3. Write code required to add a full-screen map to your page using the Google Maps API.
4. Write code required to add map markers identifying a number of locations you are interested in within this neighborhood.
5. Implement the search bar functionality to search your map markers.
6. Implement a list view of the identified locations.
7. Add additional functionality using third-party APIs when a map marker, search result, or list view entry is clicked (ex. Yelp reviews, Wikipedia, StreetView/Flickr images, etc). If you need a refresher on making AJAX requests to third-party servers.
8. Other functionalities you think might be helpful to your users. (optional, you can just improvise)
